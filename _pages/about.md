I am invested into understanding how AI can be used to improve systems security tasks, with a particular emphasis on settings in which attackers adapt quickly to new defenses. In this context, I am currently exploring how to measure, mitigate and prevent concept drift in ML-based detection systems; how to measure and improve robustness of systems to adversarial attacks while taking into account problem-space constraints (such as preserving semantics of modified code); and how to explain what these systems are doing, both from an attacker's and a defender's perspective.

I also care deeply about the practicality of our proposed solutions, and on understanding implications and limitations of using AI in the context of computer security. To this purpose, I also regularly engage and collaborate with industry. I mostly work on malware analysis and network traffic, but I am becoming more interested in understanding inner workings of AI and ML models to improve their trustworthiness in more general security scenarios. 

I am always looking for motivated students and collaborators passionate about these topics. If you are interested in joining my team, or even just visiting, have a look [here](/opportunities/).
